#
# Prompt:
# "Write me docstrings for dice.py
# [uploaded dice.py]
# Return just the docstrings not full code.
# Write the docstrings in accordance with these instructions:
# * Write docstrings for all public modules, functions, classes,
#   and methods. Public methods including __init__ should also
#   have docstrings.
# * Always use triple double quotes around docstrings.
# * One-line docstrings should fit on a single line, with closing
#   quotes on the same line as the opening quotes, and no blank
#   line before or after.
# * Write docstrings as a command, not a description.
# * Multi-line docstrings consist of a summary line, followed by
#   a blank line, followed by a more elaborate description.
# * For functions and methods, document arguments, return values,
#   side effects, exceptions raised, and restrictions.
# * For classes, summarise behaviour and list public methods and
#   instance variables.
# * Unless the entire docstring fits on one line, place the
#   closing quotes on a line by themselves.
# * Insert a blank line after all docstrings that document a class.
# * Docstrings and comments should be wrapped at 72 characters."
